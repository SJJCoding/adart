## What is ADaRT?


**ADaRT** is a data reviewing tool that can help you find errors in annotation as well as generate visual analytics of the errors. This tool will provide an easy way to parse the dataset (and the labels), and label and classify the errors.

This tool also includes sampling capabilities where the user can create a subset of the dataset to test. This is especially useful for very large datasets where a random sampling will be a quick way to judge the quality of the dataset.

This tool will also have provision for visual representation of both dataset statistics as well as the error/label statistics and create downloadable reports. These reports can then be sent back to the annotators who can use them to improve the quality of the annotations.
